# sudoers file.
#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
# 'visudo' edits the suoders file in a safe fashion. visudo
# locks the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits,
# provides basic sanity checks, and checks for syntax errors. If
# the sudoers file is currently being edited you will receive a 
# message to try again later.
#
# See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file.
