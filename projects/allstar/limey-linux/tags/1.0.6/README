Limey Linux is a small linux distribution designed to fit on a 128MB or larger compact flash card. The
distribution is optimized to run on VIA Mini-itx motherboards with 512MB of RAM, and was originally
designed to run the Asterisk PBX for our Amatuer Radio repeater linking project app_rpt. There are
probably other uses for this distribution so I decided to make it available at the website
limeylinux.org.

Limey Linux is based on the buildroot build system which is maintained by Erik Andersen at
http://buildroot.busybox.net. I created a Makefile which calls Erik's buildroot Makefile,
downloads and builds a Linux Kernel, downloads and builds Syslinux, and sizes the root file system
for a 256MB ramdisk. The Makefile and helper scripts are also capable of initializing compact
flash devices from 128MB to 1GB in size.

The packages used to build this distribution are listed in the PACKAGES file 

To build this distribution, you will need to have a gnu-based Linux development system, high speed 
internet access, root access, disk partitioning and filesystem tools, sudo,
loopback filesystem support, and at least 2.5GB of free disk space. Once the tarball
is downloaded and extracted into a directory,
edit the Makefile to specify the raw device name of your CF reader/writer then:

make setup

make allbins

make ramdisk.img

make cf (insert a CF in your reader before running this command)

make allbins will take from 1-10 hours to complete depending upon the speed of your computer.
